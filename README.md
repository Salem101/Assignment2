# Assignment2


For task 1 I used git Bash. First I used ssh-keygen to generate the key. One my private key and a public key were generated, I added the public key to my GitHub account (specifically to this repo). 
I then went back to Git Bash and used eval 'ssh-agent' and then ssh-add to add the private key.
